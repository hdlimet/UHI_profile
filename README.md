Analysis for the urban heat island profile evolution driven by urban expansion and greening

Overview 
This study applied open-accesed data and R programing for the analysis.

Data:
This study used multiple MODIS products and one imperviousness data as follows:
MODIS daily LST data downloaded from https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLA/MYD11A1.006
MODIS monthly EVI data downloaded from https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOLA/MYD13A3.006
MODIS yearly LULC data downloaded from: https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/MOTA/MCD12Q1.006
Gong's Yearly ISA data downloaded from http://data.ess.tsinghua.edu.cn/gaia.html

Code:
The data was processed and analyzed using R 4.3.3 in three steps
step 1: city cluster and buffer buffer
step 2: ATC model fitting
step 3: statistical analysis

System requirements: Hardware requirements: A standard computer with enough RAM to support the in-memory operations is required for the installation and operations with R platform.

Software requirements: The R 4.3.3 install package is accessible on the website: [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/4.3.3/]

Installation guide: The details about R installation is accessible atï¼š[https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html]

Instruction for use: Include the data and code in one folder in your personal computer.
